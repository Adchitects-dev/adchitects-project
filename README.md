# Adchitects project

The first commit is my personal template I use when I start new projects. It contains things like
- React
- Typescript
- Styled-components
- Eslint and Prettier
and other frontend packages that I normally use in my everyday programming + react-router setup and basic components.
It helps me organize everything well and I hope it's okay to use it.
